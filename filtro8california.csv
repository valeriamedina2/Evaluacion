Having visited Southeast Asia, Oceania, Australia, Europe, Central America, and of course all over North America, one theme holds true for all our adventures: discover the true culture and flavor wherever we are. 

As your host, we'll do everything we can to make sure you get off the beaten path. We're happy to share our favorite restaurants, local hangouts, and ensure you see the true San Francisco, not just the typical touristy sites. We're into everything from scuba diving, biking, kayaking, hiking, wine, art, music, food, festivals, museums, all things teens, parks, and more. Whatever you're into, we'll point you in the right direction so you have an authentic and memorable time in San Francisco. My motto is from the great Mahatma Ghandi: ""Be the change you wish to see in the world."" Our style of hosting reflects the needs of our guests. When possible, we like to meet our guests. However we understand that many of them are busy on a tight schedule or not interested to meet us so we respect that. We want to make sure every guest is comfortable and part of that is respecting boundaries and their personal space.

Named for Mission Dolores founded in 1776, San FranciscoÃ¢â¬â¢s oldest neighborhood has some of its hottest new restaurants and galleries. Bernal Heights, Potrero Hill These neighborhoods all share a sunny outlook. Boasting some of the best weather in the city, the Mission District, Bernal Heights and Potrero Hill take advantage of an abundance of fog-free days. New restaurants and night spots are a draw while Mission Dolores, 16th and Dolores streets, is the oldest structure in San Francisco. Many of the cityÃ¢â¬â¢s pioneers are buried in an adjacent cemetery. The largest concentration of murals in the city adorn buildings, fences and walls throughout the district. Potrero HillÃ¢â¬â¢s Dogpatch neighborhood is one of 11 historic districts in the city and home to the second crookedest street (after Lombard) in the city.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/68831181/f30b50b3_original.jpg,16382,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/16382,Mark,09/05/2009,"San Francisco, CA","My Motto; ""Every Day is a Good Day!""

*As of February 27, 2022  I was fully vaccinated by way of the Pfizer all available vaccine and the two boosters available. I also contracted Covid 19 or a variant in May 2022 and fully recovered.

Something about me and my home; IÃ¢â¬â¢m gay, 64, single, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurersÃ¢â¬â¢ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for four years now and I have redirected my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner.  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city.  I am attending  Community College SF working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.

As for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.

Finally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends. 

I hope that you choose to stay.

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

Having our house on Airbnb is helping us with our daughters college fund. She graduated from High School in 2019 & has taken a gap & COVID year before deciding on a university & country that she wants to go to school in. 

Renting our home also funded a new garden apartment that will be for a long term tenant.

Airbnb also helped fund 'Tartlet Bar',  a food business Wendy had with her families farm.

We own the house together, but split our time there with Lita our daughter. We co-parent & raised our daughter in whatÃ¢â¬â¢s called a Ã¢â¬ÅnestingÃ¢â¬Â situation. One of us are usually in town & available if you need anything.

We have lived in San Francisco since 1989, we get out of the city as much as possible, but always seem to return.

Wendy is a creative consultant & avid paddle boarder. She speaks French, English, understands Spanish & is learning Portuguese. She's currently a digital nomad making her way around the continents. One of her passions is to see the world and study different cultures, which she has done extensively (she wants to be an anthropologist when she grows up ;.). 

We believe the world is Lita's education, with 3 languages and several countries already under her belt she is a gypsy at heart. SheÃ¢â¬â¢s fluent in French, Spanish, English, & is teaching herself Japanese. She took 2019/2020 to explore Europe & work in Japan before she attends a University in 2022.

Fred is French, fluent in French, English & Spanish, a photographer, entrepreneur, surfer, world traveler and owns two small business in SF; Dalva (a bar in the mission district) and Grenouille-French Vintage Antiques.

We're also doing Airbnb because we like the idea of meeting like minded travelers, people who seek adventure, people who believe we can learn from everyone we meet and enjoy absorbing other cultures as much as we do. Is it possible to be part of a community while being a gypsy and a nomad?

I grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, and became an exchange student in South Africa at the age of 16. Living abroad changed my life forever. I have since gone back to live in South Africa a second time. 

While traveling, I met amazing people including a Parisian woman, on a train, who invited me to visit her in Paris. When I arrived, she gave me the keys to her apartment and said I could stay as long as IÃ¢â¬â¢d like. From that moment on, I made a vow to help as many travelers as possible on their journeys. That is why AIRBNB appeals to me - the art of travel, connection, culture, and sharing the City I love with others. 

INTERESTS
Nature. Spiritual pursuits. Traditional Japanese culture. The art of Tea. Gardening. Enjoying animals and taking care of backyard wildlife. Exploring San Francisco. Exercise, inline skating. Reading/listening to books are my constant companions.

I am a passionate learner and love languages.  I have dabbled in English, Spanish, Afrikaans, Indo-Malay & Arabic. 

COUNTRIES IÃ¢â¬â¢VE VISITED
Japan, Peru, South Africa, Malaysia, Thailand, Switzerland, France, Belgium, & Italy.

FAMILY
My husband, Raul, is a native Peruvian who speaks excellent Spanish, loves to cook, and enjoys all types of cuisine.  He is a passionate Architect and Design Professional.  Raul is also an Artist when he can make the time.  

My Mom, Gerry, makes guest appearances.  She lives on the ground floor and is active with friends, exercising, museums, and is an avid quilter.  Like me, she is formerly from Ohio and was an active skier and sailor back in the day.  She, too, is a world traveler.

HOSTING
As a Host, I enjoy nurturing Guests and making sure they feel well cared for and even spoiled. My Guests enjoy my many versions of Ã¢â¬ÅteaÃ¢â¬Â and baked goodies, as well as wicked bowls of popcorn! 

I have always been complimented on my eye for detail and desire to make even the ordinary feel special. 

From the lovely view, peaceful setting, and friendly outdoor animal visitors, to the manner in which I go out of my way to make things unique and fulfill requests, you can count on having a positive stay and look forward to a return visit to our beloved home on the hill in exciting San Francisco.

About Villa Seabreeze: We live next door to this house and purchased it to preserve our view from above. Next thing I knew, I fell in love with fixing up this house. So, now it is very cozy and clean.

I work primarily as an attorney in digital technology area in the San Francisco Bay Area and come back home to Malibu on as many weekends as possible. My husband's boutique land use and environmental law firm is in Santa Monica. The fruit of his labor is evident when you drive up our canyon and see all the parkland. His litigation led to the preservation of this special place. (Angel Law)

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.   

If you are considering booking one of our listings, I know you will love your stay!  And for more information about our company, just search for us.

We are careful and considerate non-smoking guests who take good care of the places we stay and are looking for guests to stay in our home who will do the same. 

We have over 200 5 star reviews on our other platforms (VR/HA/TA) so you can rent with confidence that you will have a great place to stay aided by thoughtful, helpful and experienced hosts.

We are a retirement age couple who find ourselves away from San Francisco often these days. Although we love our home and we love San Francisco, we also like to travel. Now we rent our home to guests like you while we are away. When we are home we are usually working to upgrade and refresh our house. We know you will enjoy the results!

We have lived in the San Francisco area for almost 50 years and purchased our San Francisco home in 1999. In 2004 we began to spend time away and a friend suggested we offer it to guests on vacation or in San Francisco on business. We soon learned that people really enjoyed our home-like atmosphere. We are thrilled with the response we have gotten and we work hard to keep our new and returning guests contented and feeling cared for. Visitors say they appreciate our clean and well appointed home and our knowledge of the city and professional attitude.

Most guests mention the feeling of a being in a real home as soon as they enter. We think this is because we still live there part of each year and keep the house comfortable and well maintained not only for our guests but for ourselves as well. We are also proud of our garden, keeping it maintained even while we are away. We paint, scrape, clean, renew, update and replace parts of the house every time we come to visit. We think it shows. 

Our guests certainly enjoy our home. Read the reviews! 170 Five Star ratings on HA/VR and 75 on TA. We get these ratings not because everything is always perfect (we do try, however!) but because we go out of our way to help our guests settle in and feel at home and we respond quickly to any question. Finally, if you are bringing a car, you will absolutely love our little garage (for economy to mid-size cars). Parking rules in SF can make you dizzy. If you don't bring a car - great! - hop on the bus one block from the front door and head downtown or to the beach.

Traveling and eating my way through the world are my ultimate passions!  That's one of the reasons why I decided to work for a company where I can inspire travelers to explore this great wide world of ours and experience it like a local!

I like the big cities for their diversity in people, energetic airports and mass transit, unique architecture, rooftop vista points, cafe culture, and how could I forget the variety of nomz.  I don't care much for main street shopping or gridlock traffic.

I equally like the unbeaten path for the sense of adventure, learning the local way of life, being able to see more than 10 stars at night, and loving the fact that I'm a little blue dot in the middle of nowhere on G00gle maps.  I'm not a fan of mozzies or sunblock eye sting.

Besides traveling and eating the world, I keep an active lifestyle of hitting the gym and playing tennis and volleyball.  But please don't ask me to do any distance running.  

I live by the golden rule of mutual respect, and I also appreciate tidiness.  Your home is in good hands with me.  Smoke? No. Drink? Not so much.  Ohm nom nom? Oh hell yeah!!

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢
The prolific Seth Godin, talented blogger said creativity isnÃ¢â¬â¢t the most important part. What counts is being able to ship! Ship on time. And ship again. And again. And again.

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.

Having our house on Airbnb is helping us with our daughters college fund. She graduated from High School in 2019 & has taken a gap & COVID year before deciding on a university & country that she wants to go to school in. 

Renting our home also funded a new garden apartment that will be for a long term tenant.

Airbnb also helped fund 'Tartlet Bar',  a food business Wendy had with her families farm.

We own the house together, but split our time there with Lita our daughter. We co-parent & raised our daughter in whatÃ¢â¬â¢s called a Ã¢â¬ÅnestingÃ¢â¬Â situation. One of us are usually in town & available if you need anything.

We have lived in San Francisco since 1989, we get out of the city as much as possible, but always seem to return.

Wendy is a creative consultant & avid paddle boarder. She speaks French, English, understands Spanish & is learning Portuguese. She's currently a digital nomad making her way around the continents. One of her passions is to see the world and study different cultures, which she has done extensively (she wants to be an anthropologist when she grows up ;.). 

We believe the world is Lita's education, with 3 languages and several countries already under her belt she is a gypsy at heart.

Fred is French, fluent in French, English & Spanish, a photographer, entrepreneur, surfer, world traveler and owns two small business in SF; Dalva (a bar in the mission district) and Grenouille-French Vintage Antiques.

We're also doing Airbnb because we like the idea of meeting like minded travelers, people who seek adventure, people who believe we can learn from everyone we meet and enjoy absorbing other cultures as much as we do.

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

For me thereÃ¢â¬â¢s nothing in my life that I am more grateful for than my three adult sons who were also my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s greatest challenge to raise as a single mother in San Francisco.  

In the crucible of parenthood, I have learned so much about working with people and developed qualities that are enormously beneficial in the world of work. When you have children whose lives depend on you, thereÃ¢â¬â¢s no such thing as Ã¢â¬ÅI canÃ¢â¬â¢tÃ¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬ÅIÃ¢â¬â¢m tiredÃ¢â¬Â or Ã¢â¬ÅI couldnÃ¢â¬â¢t make it happen becauseÃ¢â¬Â¦Ã¢â¬Â Year in and year out, in lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s longest marathon, it became a deeply engrained habit to give my best every day and make it happen. 

Being the sole responsible person for three growing boys required discipline, patience, diplomacy, negotiating skills, selflessness, tenacity, compassion, tenderness, endurance, resourcefulness, toughness and, last but not least, a thick skin. These same qualities are the foundation that has allowed me to succeed as an Executive Assistant for top executives at some stimulating and interesting companies, including early stage, privately held, and household-name corporations.  
Perhaps the greatest blessing of all is good health and IÃ¢â¬â¢m grateful for that as well.  IÃ¢â¬â¢ve been told by so many people that I have more energy than anyone theyÃ¢â¬â¢ve ever known that there must be some truth to it. In my entire life, I have very rarely been sick Ã¢â¬â even a common cold. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s my belief this amazing gift of health and energy Ã¢â¬â of life Ã¢â¬â could be given to everyone in the world in equal measure to what I have received.  ItÃ¢â¬â¢s my belief that this gift carries with it the responsibility to give my best to those I serve, and to make the world a better place.

Having our house on Airbnb is helping us with our daughters college fund. She graduated from High School in 2019 & has taken a gap & COVID year before deciding on a university & country that she wants to go to school in. 

Renting our home also funded a new garden apartment that will be for a long term tenant.

Airbnb also helped fund 'Tartlet Bar',  a food business Wendy had with her families farm.

We own the house together, but split our time there with Lita our daughter. We co-parent & raised our daughter in whatÃ¢â¬â¢s called a Ã¢â¬ÅnestingÃ¢â¬Â situation. One of us are usually in town & available if you need anything.

We have lived in San Francisco since 1989, we get out of the city as much as possible, but always seem to return.

Wendy is a creative consultant & avid paddle boarder. She speaks French, English, understands Spanish & is learning Portuguese. She's currently a digital nomad making her way around the continents. One of her passions is to see the world and study different cultures, which she has done extensively (she wants to be an anthropologist when she grows up ;.). 

We believe the world is Lita's education, with 3 languages and several countries already under her belt she is a gypsy at heart. SheÃ¢â¬â¢s fluent in French, Spanish, English, & is teaching herself Japanese. She took 2019/2020 to explore Europe & work in Japan before she attends a University in 2022.

Fred is French, fluent in French, English & Spanish, a photographer, entrepreneur, surfer, world traveler and owns two small business in SF; Dalva (a bar in the mission district) and Grenouille-French Vintage Antiques.

We're also doing Airbnb because we like the idea of meeting like minded travelers, people who seek adventure, people who believe we can learn from everyone we meet and enjoy absorbing other cultures as much as we do. Is it possible to be part of a community while being a gypsy and a nomad?

I am a healer, working with Hospice. I am inspired to drink life up, understanding that there is a finite amount of life to be had. I love to travel. My last amazing journey was to the Amazon. Even more memorable than the visual aspects of that trip were the auditory surprises. In addition to the contant vibrational buzzing and hissing in the air, I have 2 words for you, especially if you get to the Amazon: ""Howler Monkeys"". They truly sound like I imagine dinosaurs would sound. Apparently they get such volume and monster howl from a hole in a bone in their throats. Must be heard to be believed. But I digress! I'm a weekly dancer, pulling out the boots for two step, the retro wear for East Coast swing, and I waltz every chance I get no matter what I'm wearing. I love beautiful found objects. I write poetry and short stories. I have a private psychotherapy practice and teach mindfulness to people who are interested in more resiliency, more ZEST!

The cleaners and I wear masks during cleaning. We use trash bags to avoid contact with trash and simplify cleaning the trash cans.  We try to run two loads of dishes between guests, so you may find a load running when you arrive.

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

We are Tim and Lisa.  These are a few of our favorite things: Our adopted city of San Francisco (we've both lived here over 3 decades), our local neighborhood (the Richmond District), meeting people, nature (birds/beaches/hiking/etc.), live music (especially at SF's fantastic music venues, including the music festivals right here in Golden Gate Park), food, and our family (we have 2 adult daughters and 2 grandkids).  We met while teaching at the well-respected preschool that Tim co-founded in 1984.  Tim comes from a hotel/restaurant family (The Treadway Inns in New England), and now newly retired, he looks forward to returning to his family roots as a friendly and helpful host.  Tim loves to garden and cook. Lisa still happily teaches 2-, 3- and 4-year-olds (coming up on her 31st year at the same school).  Like Tim, she is also from the East Coast (NY).  We put tons of love, care, comfort and quality into building our new apartment, as we expect to live down there ourselves one day.

I was born and raised in San Francisco and the Peninsula. I generally concentrate a lot on work, but on my spare time I like to create social gatherings, pig out at new restaurants, go hiking, read & listen to Audible, play with my dogs, and go to dance classes

We have been Airbnb guests and hosts for many years.  We are currently hosting in our primary home in San Francisco and love to provide families with a comfortable, fun and welcoming space when they are visiting our city.  We love meeting people, experiencing new cultures and sharing our space. 

I consider myself extraordinarily lucky to have been born and raised in the most beautiful city in the world - San Francisco - and I have always loved sharing it with visitors.  Since I'm an active person, I fully take advantage of all of the open spaces and trails that the SF bay area has to offer and I love taking visitors on hikes, walks, and bike rides.  And because food is one of my favorite things, I love eating in new (and old) restaurants, cafes and food trucks.  A few of my favorites in SF are La Ciccia, Al's Place and of course Off the Grid.  

Let us know if you have any questions about your visit to SF or if our home might be a good fit for you!

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

I love this quote. 
I am that wanderer, incredibly lucky to be infected with the passion and audacity to travel often and solo. 
I was born and raised in San Francisco. I am a native. I love my city. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve watched it evolve. But I have also left it many times in my youth. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left it to study abroad in France. Best decision of my college life! I backpacked solo around western Europe. 
IÃ¢â¬â¢ve left SF when I was in the military and stationed around our country. IÃ¢â¬â¢ve also driven as far north as Niagara Falls.
Career wise, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve spent over a decade in property management and rentals. I'm also a realtor. As a hobby, I write as often as possible, a pen and notebook on me at all times.
I am cursed with this blessing of being unceasingly interested in people. I love meeting people. I love hearing stories. And I love writing them. 
As I review my lifeÃ¢â¬â¢s experiences, IÃ¢â¬â¢ve come upon one very simple realization, that proclaimed secret of success. It is merely this: Ã¢â¬ËSay what you will do and do what you will say.Ã¢â¬â¢

Prior COVID I have served breakfast and dinner every day and I am sad that I canÃ¢â¬â¢t do it anymore but the heart the love and the overall integrity is intact. 
If you know few things about Lebanese people, as I am one, family, values, generosity, insecurity, our priorities in our lives. That is what you will have in my home, a precious place that I have been living and growing with my children and hundreds of plants and trees for the last 29 yearsÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â
We all live great lives, I am a designer/manufacturer working in China since the 90s so it makes it impossible  to continue easily when anyone with special needs or hotel mentality book our bedrooms. Please make sure to understand that I run an extremely tight ship and have eyes on every detail. We attend all matters immediately not only caring for all and everything but to make sure that issues are stoped before they begin.
Our home and neighborhood are extremely safe and as a designer with three amazingly gifted hard working adult children, we have designed this Jungle/Museum/Doll House and sanctuary. Clean air and environment, clean bathrooms and bedrooms are what awaits you, so welcome and enjoy these walls that express what I envision in my heart and soul as beautiful, all blending with art from different countries and periods in history, plants and colorsÃ¢ÂÂ¤Ã¯Â¸Â 

We are super blessed and protected by a team of four fantastic Christian humans that work for us and help us keep it all magnificently well and clean for over sixteen years, that trust and security is PRICELESS and if it is the LordÃ¢â¬â¢s will, it will be yours too.
Our home faces the Pacific Ocean, about 50 blocks away and when it is not foggy, our sunsets are dream-like! That said, the fog crawls up from the ocean and literally sits on top of our homes and neighborhood most of the time, specially during the summer, thus, I cannot express enough the importance the travel accordingly.
There will probably be other guests like you during your stay so we ask to whisper between 8 PM and 10 in the morning and if youÃ¢â¬â¢re going to be on the phone, you absolutely have to wear your headphones. Equally important is to notice that to enjoy good internet, as we all work online, we will ask that you choose ONE device for Wifi access. 

In order to keep control of all details, my children and I personally are constantly here to help, explain and be of any assistance to you all, so to be informed of any and all needs you might have: we WILL TRULY do our maximum to accommodate you so always let US KNOW what you need, please!

In as much as the prices in our listings are concerned, we are happy to offer a rate that is at least 60% off in comparison to our  neighbors because we are blessed enough so love to share!

I, the lucky mom and house owner, Lulu, speak eight languages, studying my ninth now and I am fortunate enough to travel around the world for business.

We look forward to sharing our lives with yÃ¢â¬â¢all!

And of course, I love to travel. My goal is to visit all seven continents. So far I have traveled to ten countries on three continents. 

IÃ¢â¬â¢m fluent in Chinese, proficient in English, and conversational in Italian and Spanish. I enjoy meeting people from different parts of the world and looking forward to connecting with you as your Airbnb host.

Peace, Love, No war.

I'm born and raised here in San Francisco, and have lived here all my life.  Thank you so much for considering being our guest =)

When we are not exploring new places to eat and drink (happy to provide suggestions!), we are typically taking our toddler around the city to the many parks and recreation areas in the Bay Area.

Living here for so long, I think what I love about the city are the diverse personalities and creative energy that make up the culture of San Francisco.  

I love meeting new people and look forward to providing you the best possible experience. I live upstairs and am happy to answer any questions you may have.

Together with my girlfriend, we run the short term rental property management company. We also provide great returns for our clients by investing into properties in the Bay Area and the Central Valley. .

I'm from South Africa and lived in Tokyo, Japan before moving to San Francisco over 25 years ago. I gave up my Business Development career in 2016 to focus full-time on short-term rentals. 

I have traveled to 50+ countries and stayed at some amazing places. I know what a difference great hospitality can make. I thus strive to create an experience at Standout Stays that will be memorable and unique. My aim is that you will come back and stay at our properties again each time you are back in the area.   

As a guest, I am responsible, trustworthy, and neat. Being a host myself, I can completely put myself in your shoes and am very respectful of your space. I love AirBNB because it affords one the opportunity to live like a local when you travel to a new area.  

I enjoy spending time with my dog (Dexter), working out, hiking, skiing, and generally making the most of life.   

If you are considering booking one of our listings, I know you will love your stay!  And for more information about our company, just search for us.

I'm Jerry.  I recently renovated Precita Village in very convenient Bernal Heights to share the opportunity to experience the old town feel of San Francisco with all the new modern conveniences.  Precita Village was built in 1923, celebrating its 100th Centennial anniversary.

I keep the apt extremely clean and expect our guests to try their best.  We are a NO outdoor shoe property and bathrooms and common areas are cleaned daily. 

We also UV and Ozone treat all our rooms between guest visits to ensure clean fresh and sanitized rooms when you get here.  

Bernal Heights is a lovely and exciting neighborhood where you will meet the nicest people, friendly dogs, and cute kids running around.  There are also many singles to mingle with a 2-Star Michelin across the street. It is convenient and safe, and within 15 minutes from SFO and Downtown.  Experience downtown without living in it.

I have 8 different themed rooms on 2 floors with 2 brand new kitchens and full size dining tables for 8 to enjoy your meals, mingle with other guests or  chill and just watch some TV and a nice patio with a view of twin peaks and sutro towers to have breakfast or to work from on sunny days.

I've got some neat furniture and artwork with some fun and interesting stories attached to them.

I'm Jerry.  I recently renovated Precita Village in very convenient Bernal Heights to share the opportunity to experience the old town feel of San Francisco with all the new modern conveniences.  Precita Village was built in 1923, celebrating its 100th Centennial anniversary.

I keep the apt extremely clean and expect our guests to try their best.  We are a NO outdoor shoe property and bathrooms and common areas are cleaned daily. 

We also UV and Ozone treat all our rooms between guest visits to ensure clean fresh and sanitized rooms when you get here.  

Bernal Heights is a lovely and exciting neighborhood where you will meet the nicest people, friendly dogs, and cute kids running around.  There are also many singles to mingle with a 2-Star Michelin across the street. It is convenient and safe, and within 15 minutes from SFO and Downtown.  Experience downtown without living in it.

I have 8 different themed rooms on 2 floors with 2 brand new kitchens and full size dining tables for 8 to enjoy your meals, mingle with other guests or  chill and just watch some TV and a nice patio with a view of twin peaks and sutro towers to have breakfast or to work from on sunny days.

I've got some neat furniture and artwork with some fun and interesting stories attached to them. 

I welcome you to join us at Precita Village next time you're in town.
