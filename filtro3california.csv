I love what San Francisco city and the Bay Area has to offer. I feel very lucky and privileged to live in a beautiful and safe area of San Francisco called Pacific Heights. 

I am an avid mountaineer/climber and I travel usually once a year, for a month - long expedition trip. That is usually when I open the calendar in AirBnB for my apartment, as well as (separately) for my garage. 

I would like to rent my beautiful home to someone reliable for all that time when I am gone. 

The things I can't live without are my family, friends, mountains, my amazing home, nature, meditation and any kind of physical activity daily. 

My favorite travel destinations - to many to mention. I feel amazing in high altitude mountains. 

I climbed all the highest mountains in the world called Seven Summits (including Mt.Everest), as well as skied to the South Pole.  Beside that, all my travels and expeditions left me with amazing memories. 

My favorite books - too many to list here as I  read a lot, but I love the most  ""Master and Margarita"" by Michail Bulhakov. There are many books in my home, so if you have time feel free to read something new. I switched now to ebooks or audiobooks, as it doesn't take any physical space. 

My favorite food is prepared with local and organic ingredients - check out many restaurants on Fillmore street - you will have so many to choose from, even after Pandemic years. I love sushi and the best sushi in the city is a walking distance from my home - check out Tataki restaurant (on California street/Divisadero street) - amazing and fresh! 
I also would encourage you to check Ã¢â¬ÅState Bird ProvisionsÃ¢â¬Â, but you would need a reservation. ItÃ¢â¬â¢s a 7 -10 minutes walking distance from my home. Located on Fillmore street. 

I travel a lot for business - Marriott hotels, but for fun - I prefer staying in a tent or in a cool Airbnb place in different cities all over the world. 

My motto in life is to live largely, Ã¢â¬Åon the edge of my comfort zone"", hence climbing or polar expeditions, and now posting my home at Airbnb website. 

Throughout the process of renting my home I learn that my HOAÃ¢â¬â¢s CC&Rs (Homeowners Rules) do not allow for any short term rentals and I can only rent it for a month or longer. 

My modern apartment is located on the top floor of the beautiful Victorian (freshly painted) building (originally from 1896). I have the best view of Japan Town and Twin Towers as well as complete privacy in my home. 

I love green plants and I have many in my home and at the balcony. IÃ¢â¬â¢ll be very grateful if you could please water it once a week ( just a little bit :) to keep it lush and green. 

So far, I had wonderful guests from all over the world for the last ten years. I am super grateful for all people I met through AirBnB. 

Please feel free to ask me any questions before you send a reservation. 

I look forward to meeting you in person and to host you in my home.

*As of February 27, 2022  I was fully vaccinated by way of the Pfizer all available vaccine and the two boosters available. I also contracted Covid 19 or a variant in May 2022 and fully recovered.

Something about me and my home; IÃ¢â¬â¢m gay, 64, single, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurersÃ¢â¬â¢ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for four years now and I have redirected my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner.  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city.  I am attending  Community College SF working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.

As for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.

Finally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends. 

I hope that you choose to stay.

 Louise writes and is working on her fifth book. We both love to interact with people of all ages and we are tolerant and open people. Jim  loves to read and keep up with the news and seeing art. We both love reading both fiction and non-fiction,  visiting museums, watching movies, seeing plays, visiting with family and friends and experiencing the great outdoors. We love meeting new people from all around the world. We travel back East once a year to visit family, and Louise recently taught a workshop in St. Thomas where her sister lives. We love to travel in California, as well. Louise went to the U. of Wisconsin and keeps up with college friends and she and Jim both attended the University of Buffalo. We visit Buffalo where Jim grew up and New York City where Louise grew up! We also have grandchildren in Connecticut so love to visit the East Coast.

New restaurants and night spots are a draw while Mission Dolores, 16th and Dolores streets, is the oldest structure in San Francisco. Many of the cityÃ¢â¬â¢s pioneers are buried in an adjacent cemetery. The largest concentration of murals in the city adorn buildings, fences and walls throughout the district.

*As of February 27, 2022  I was fully vaccinated by way of the Pfizer all available vaccine and the two boosters available. I also contracted Covid 19 or a variant in May 2022 and fully recovered.

Something about me and my home; IÃ¢â¬â¢m gay, 64, single, very fit and energetic, very outgoing and easy going. I have always lived in California and have traveled the world extensively. I absolutely love San Francisco and even more being in the Mission District. Entrepreneurial spirited, at age twenty-one I started a business which fulfilled insurersÃ¢â¬â¢ responsibilities for auto losses involving vandalism and retired from that adventure just shy of 36 years later.  I have been vegan for four years now and I have redirected my culinary skills towards all things plant, sugar-free, and fat-free based cuisine.  I enjoy practicing yoga at Love Story just around the corner.  I am also an avid bicyclist and use my bike as my primary mode of transport in the city.  I am attending  Community College SF working my way to a zoological degree. Life is good.

As for my home, the location and views are arguably the best the Mission District can offer. The private roof deck, a green oasis for the otherwise concrete jungle of a Mission Street residence. My place faces west so it's on the street side and is usually quite noisy from people, traffic and sirens. Thankfully the residence was constructed in 2008 and  built  quite soundproof. The bedrooms are well sized and comfortably appointed. The sun always seems to shine in the Mission District.

Finally, I love being an AirBnB host which allows me to share my good fortune, meet wonderful people and make new friends. 

I hope that you choose to stay.

We are native San Franciscans and love to share our city with guests from all over the world. The Guest Suite was built for friends and family and we only started renting it as a favor to a friend who helped with the construction. It has been a great experience for us.

I love to cook and may start either an Italian cooking class or a market tour of San Francisco. I have provided informal winery tours to guests, trips to Muir Woods, and trips down the Pacific coast. All tours involve a restaurant stop. Even the Guest Suite has cookbooks about San Francisco restaurants, markets, and grocery stores. 

Thanks to our guests, we are now able to travel twice a year.

Growing up in West Covina, it was only apropos that this gem happened to be located on Covina Avenue.  If that wasn't enough coincidence, the property was built the year Rajvi's late mother was born. Simply stated, it was meant to be! Teaming up with brilliant Canadian born and San Francisco based architect Ian Murray and locally loved and amazingly talented general contractor Don Robinson, Rajvi set out on a renovation path that lasted nearly nine months.  Partnering with her husband Gurinder and  experienced SuperHost Susan Bailey (a UCLA Bruin nonetheless) to manage the property - Rajvi is now perfectly positioned to share her ""Sea of Love"" with guests from all around the world.

We are both natives to the Bay Area, growing up in Marin and Napa counties and now calling Santa Rosa our home.

After many summers of pool parties and barbecues, we realized we'd love to open our home to visitors to the area, share our beautiful retreat with others and welcome them as we would our own family and friends. We've enjoyed Airbnb stays in our own travels and so it seems a perfect fit! 

We have both run a variety of businesses and are narrowing down our passions to make them full-time gigs. 

Janet is pursuing a career as a Pilates instructor and physical therapist, currently running the health and wellness center at UCSF working through grad school pursuing a doctorate in physical therapy. Spenser manages a multi-use events venue in San Francisco, in a free time he's building an organic vegetable garden, honing his golf game and seeking out new locales for exploring.

Together, we like to travel and meet new people, hike, cook, work in the yard, read, and play vintage video games. 

We seeks to offer an inclusive environment for all guests and welcome all people, regardless of race, religion, age, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, national origin or disability.
